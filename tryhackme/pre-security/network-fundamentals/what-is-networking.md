# What is networking?

## 📘 Summary
This was my first room after the intro, I learned what is networking, IP, MAC address, etc...

## 🧠 What I Learned
- What is a network? - A 2 or more things(devices) that are connected and they can communicate with each others
- What is the internet? - A giant network that consist of many small networks, it was invented by Tim Berners-Lee 1989
- Devices are identified mostly by IP and Mac Adresses
- IP Addresses follow a set of standards known as protocols
- What is protocols? - Protocols are the backbone of networking and force many devices to communicate in the same language
- The difference between a public (ex: 85.53.66.32) and a private (ex: 192.168.1.77) IP address
- There is 2 IP adress versions: IPv4 and IPv6 cause IPv4 has only 2^32 = 4.29 billion in range, and we have more than a 50b device
- How to use the `ping` tool to use ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to determine the performance of a connection between devices, for example, if the connection exists or is reliable

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- `ping` – to determine the performance and connection

## 💡 Reflections
This room made me realize how internet works, networks and IP/MAC addresses works.
