# Intro to LAN:

## 📘 Summary
This room introduced me to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, a 7-layer framework that explains how devices communicate over a network. Each layer has its own role, and together they ensure data moves from one device to another reliably.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Layer 7 – Application: Where users interact (apps, browsers, email). Examples: HTTP, FTP, DNS.
- Layer 6 – Presentation: Translates, encrypts, or compresses data (e.g., SSL/TLS encryption).
- Layer 5 – Session: Manages sessions (opening, maintaining, closing). Example: logging into a website.
- Layer 4 – Transport: Controls reliability and data delivery. Protocols: TCP (reliable), UDP (fast).
- Layer 3 – Network: Handles addressing and routing. Protocols: IP, ICMP. Devices: routers.
- Layer 2 – Data Link: Deals with frames and MAC addresses. Devices: switches. Protocols: Ethernet, ARP.
- Layer 1 – Physical: The actual medium — cables, radio waves, electrical signals.

no tools, only knowledge

## 💡 Reflections
Before I thought sending an email is easy, the OSI model made me realize how structured and layered networking is, and how attackers can strike at each level.
