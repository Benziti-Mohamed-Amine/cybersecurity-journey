# Packets & Frames

## 📘 Summary
Learned the difference between **packets** and **frames** in network communication.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- **Packet** – unit of data at the Network layer (contains IP info).  
- **Frame** – unit of data at the Data Link layer (contains MAC addresses).  
- Switches forward **frames** to correct devices using MAC addresses.  
- Encapsulation: IP packets are inside frames.

## 💡 Reflections
Understanding packets vs frames clarified how data travels within LANs and over the internet.
