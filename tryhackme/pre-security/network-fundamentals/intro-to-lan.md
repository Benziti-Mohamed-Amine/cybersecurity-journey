# Intro to LAN:

## 📘 Summary
This room introduced me to the foundations of Local Area Networks (LANs). It was challenging but rewarding, and I realized how much happens in the background when devices communicate.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- LAN Topologies: Star, Bus, Ring, and Mesh (Star is the most common in practice).
- Subnetting: Dividing a network into smaller logical parts for efficiency, organization, and sometimes security.
- Subnet IP Types:
    Network Address (identifies the subnet)
    Broadcast Address (used to reach all devices in the subnet)
    Host Addresses (usable IPs, including the router’s Default Gateway).
- ARP (Address Resolution Protocol): Maps an IP address to a MAC address so devices can identify each other. Uses ARP Request → ARP Reply.
- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): Assigns IP addresses automatically using the DORA process:
    Discover → Offer → Request → Acknowledge.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
no tools, only knowledge

## 💡 Reflections
This room made me realize that network is way bigger to understand, with a point click to send a message, a tousands of protocols and things happens in blink of an eye, and LAN is a big stone in networking in general.
