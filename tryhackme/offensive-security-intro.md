# Offensive Security Intro – TryHackMe

## 📘 Summary
This was my first step into offensive security. I learned the basics of what offensive security means — simulating real hacker actions to uncover vulnerabilities — and practiced hacking a fake bank web application in a safe environment.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- The difference between offensive and defensive security
- The idea of ethical hacking: hacking systems legally to improve security
- How to use the terminal in a virtual machine
- How to use the `dirb` tool to brute-force and discover hidden URLs
- How hidden pages like `/bank-deposit` can allow unauthorized actions

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- `dirb` – for discovering hidden URLs on websites
- Wordlist: `/usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt`

## 💡 Reflections
This room made me realize how small mistakes in web design (like predictable URLs) can become major security issues. It was exciting to try out hacking tools in a safe, legal way.
